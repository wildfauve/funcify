      # @param enforcer  A fn that responds to #call which will be performed when the authorisations fail
      # @param policies  An array of Policy checkers.  The policy takes optional state and ctx and returns a Maybe. Available checkers are:
      #                  + Afn.activity_policy
      #                  + Afn.slack_token_policy
      # @param ctx       A data structure of the user's authz context understood by the policy checker; e.g. the activity being performed
      # Example
      # > Afn.authorise.(Afn.auth_error_raise_enforcer.(PolicyEnforcement::AuthorisationFailed))
      #                .([Afn.activity_policy.(system_policy)])
      #                .(activity_ctx(:create))
      # => Success(nil) | raises a PolicyEnforcement::AuthorisationFailed
      # Use partial evaluation by establishing the enforcer and policies (which returns a partially applied authorise fn)
      # passing this to the services to be protected, which that evaluate the fn by providing the ctx.

      # ------------

      # The Activity-based access control policy
      # ----------------------------------------
      # @param activities [String] A collection of activity strings assigned to the user obtained from Identity.  For example:

      #                   any activities not associated with the system under test.  Fn.identity could be used to retain
      #                   all activities, or you can use any other fn that takes the activities as the last param      
      # @param ctx {}  service/resource/action being tested; e.g. {:resource=>:invoice, :action=>:create}
